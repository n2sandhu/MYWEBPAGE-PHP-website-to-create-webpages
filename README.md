MyWebsite - a PHP website to create your own webpage
==============================

This website is developed in PHP and allows the user to create webpages for their own website. The user is presented with
number of options while creating a webpage and can select from number of available templates, background images and poster images.
In addition to this user can also create an account in the website and check the pages that were designed by other users. Further more the
user can also edit the webpages that were designed by him/her. Only a small flaw that exists is user has to select the template again while
editing a webpage(should be easy to fix..).
Enjoy,
CHEERS
